📚 What Is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It underlies many modern applications like search engines, translation, chatbots, sentiment analysis, and more. Tasks often include:

Text cleaning & preprocessing

Tokenization & embeddings

Classification & sentiment analysis

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Language modeling and more

This repository serves as a hands‑on starting point for learning these techniques using Python
